# Simple_Calculator
  calculator is a device which helps to do operations between any number of operands.
  html,css and basic javascript are used in creation.
  eval() method of javascript used to do operations.
  I used javascript concept inside html file only.
  Here,I applied css in good way such that calculator became too interactive to see and use.
